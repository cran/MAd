\title{Meta-Analysis Aggregation
}
\description{This fuction will simultaneously aggregate all within-study effect sizes while taking into account the correlations among the within-study outcome measures (Gleser & Olkin 2009; Gleser & Olkin 2009; Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Rosenthal et al., 2006). The default imputed correlation between within-study effect sizes is set at .50 (Wampold et al., 1997) and will compute an aggregated effect size for each study. This default of .50 is adjustable.  This \code{MAd} aggregation function implements Gleser & Olkin's (1994; 2009) recommended procedures for aggregating dependent effect sizes.}
\usage{
agg(id, g, var, n.1, n.2, cor = .50, mod=NULL, data)
}
\arguments{
 \item{id}{Study id with multiple rows of same id.
}
\item{g}{Hedges g (unbiased estimate of d) effect size.
}
\item{var}{Vaiance of g.
}
\item{n.1}{Sample size of group one.
}
\item{n.2}{Sample size of group two.
}
\item{cor}{Estimated correlation among within-study outcome variables. Default is .50 based on Wampold et al. (1997) recommended procedure.
}
\item{mod}{Default is NULL. To aggregate by id and one moderator. If there are multiple levels of a categorical moderator within study and one can in derive seperate effect size estimates for each level within and between studies. However, there will be dependency issues and one way to resolve is shown below in the examples. 
}
\item{data}{\code{data.frame} with above values.
}
}
\value{Outputs a \code{data.frame} with aggregated effect sizes where each study is reduced to one row per study (unless aggregated by a moderator) by a weighted average formula. This formula is based on Gleser & Olkin's (1994) approach to aggregation of dependent effect sizes (see chapter 22, pp. 339-356).
